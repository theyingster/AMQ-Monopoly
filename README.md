# AMQ-Monopoly

A special gamemode simulating the popular game "Monopoly" that can be played on [Anime Music Quiz](https://animemusicquiz.com). See [board](https://aggie.io/wrol4b_f2z) and [rules](https://pastebin.com/ELFyssDS) for more information about the gamemode.

## Installation

Requires [Tampermonkey](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo?hl=en) browser extension to apply the script:

1. Select the script to be installed (do all three steps for both scripts)
2. Click "raw"
3. Tampermonkey should prompt you to install the script; if it does not, create a new script in dashboard and directly copy paste the code in and save

## Current Version

Currently requires manually inputting commands into chat and needs both scripts for playing and scoring. I am working on integrating auto-changing settings without manual commands from the host player (testing through the change_settings.user.js file).
